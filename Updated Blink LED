  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control.
  On the UNO, MEGA and ZEROit is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. 
  LED_BUILTIN is set to the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  You can see this light flickering display on an Arduino hardware board 
  The circuit type of LED is connected to a digital pin and the number of the pin differs from each board type.
  For example, On the UNO, MEGA and ZEROit is attached to digital pin 13 and on the MKR1000 it is attached to digital pin 6. 
  LED_BUILTIN is set to the correct LED pin independent of which board is used which allows easy control of the built-in LED circuit.
  This is called the LED_BUILTIN.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products 
  (multiple corresponding connections between the LED and digital pin based on the board types are listed there).

  To show or see how an external LED is lit, you will need to construct a circuit.
  For example.
  For an UNO board with a LED_BUILTIN digital pin of 13, simply connect the positive, long 'leg' of the LED (anode) to the oppoiste end of the resistor 
  (A resistor is required to prevent damage to both the LED and the Ardunio, limiting the amount of voltage flowing through the current through the LED)
  Then proceed to connect the negative, short 'leg' of the LED (cathode) to the GND (ground).
  However you can choose whatever resistor value you desire by Ohm's law (V = IR).
  This states that V is the desired hardware board's voltage, taken away by the drop in the voltage of the LED itself.
  This selection of the resistor value ensures safe operation and health and safety pratices for the person and the hardware itself.
